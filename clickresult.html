<h1 style="text-align: center;">
	Hello friend!<br>
	You are here because you clicked the purchase button on PMS Corp.'s website.<br>
	First of all, don't worry you didn't get a virus.<br>
	BUT, WHAT IS WRONG WITH WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SABOTAGE SOMEONE<br>
</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Alright, let's settle down and talk. What did your parents do to you when you were a child?<br>
What catastrophic event happened that you would want to sabotage somebody else's website. <br>
I'm not even angry I'm sad at this point. Why would you click on that button? Was it for a joke?<br>
Do you seriously hate someone enough that you clicked on the purchase button?<br>
Hope your life gets better, bye!
